# ps1Helpers

This is a set of small executables that should really be shell scripts. Support is going to be minimal,  
but I will try to fix issues as they crop up.

## Compiling
    // While inside of project directory. The important thing is that the path supplied
    // to cmake points to the project root directory
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    make install

Note: Depends on [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2).

## Installing
Currently, as I am really only putting this out there as a here, see what you want to do with it sort  
of thing, there are no packages distributed for any Linux distro.
